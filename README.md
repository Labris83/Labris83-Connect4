This i a simple Score4/Connect4 game made in Java inside Eclipse.


HOW TO PLAY.
This game has to be played with two players. The players enter their names,chips of selection(x or o) and the dimensions of the board
that they want to play in.There is an empty board in the start of every game and in order to win a game the players have to connect 4 identical
chips in a row, by dropping a chip to the column of their selection. If the board becomes full without a winner,  the game is considered a draw. After a game is completed, the player are asked if they
want to play again.


This is my first ever Java and object oriented project. This was a project that i had to submit for my Object Oriented Class in my university but i was late 
so i decided to make it quickly before i have to submit the second project. I started learning java in the start of November 2024 and i started
this project on November 11. I didn't work on it every day but it took me about 10-15 hours. I want to thank the University Of Macedonia that provided 
video lectures that i can watch whenever i want and any other Java tutorial i watched.
